            <h4>Probablistic Mortality Prediction</h4>

            <p>This is calculator is the deployment of the model produced as a result of the analysis of data from 127,134 adult emergency laparotomies 
            included in the National Emergency Lapatomy Audit (<a href="https://www.nela.org.uk/">NELA</a>). The code for our analysis is avilable on
             <a href="https://github.com/finncatling/lap-risk">GitHub</a> under MIT License</p>

            <p>The work has been submitted to a journal but has <b>NOT</b> yet been peer reviewed and the model is yet to recieve a CE mark. Therefore 
            the form and API offered here should currently be used <i>ONLY</i> for educational and research purposes and should <u>NOT</u> be used to guide patient care. </p>

            <h5>Model Overview</h5>

            <p>The model is uncertainty aware model of mortality after emergency lapraotomy. Lactate and Albumin, if left blank, are imputed using dedicated
            imputation Generalised Additive Models (GAMs). All other fields are required. The final probabilty distribtion comprises 1000 samples from a final
            mortality GAM </p>
