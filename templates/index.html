            <h4>Probabilistic Mortality Prediction in Emergency Laparotomy</h4>

            <p>
                This calculator predicts risk of death in hospital in the 60 days following
                <a href="https://www.nela.org.uk/Criteria">emergency surgery on the gastrointestinal tract</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mortality risk model was developed using data from 127,134 adult emergency laparotomies
                included in the UK's <a href="https://www.nela.org.uk/">National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA)</a>.

                This work has <b>not</b> yet completed peer review and the model is yet to receive a CE mark. Therefore

                research purposes and should <b>not</b> be used to inform patient care.

            <h5>Uncertainty-aware predictions</h5>
            <p>
                Our model predicts distributions over mortality risk, where the width (dispersion) of the distribution
                reflects our uncertainty about the patient's true underlying mortality risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                In patients where lactate and albumin have not yet been measured, these values can be left blank in the
                web calculator or API input, and will be imputed using dedicated imputation Generalised Additive Models
                (GAMs). All other fields are required.
